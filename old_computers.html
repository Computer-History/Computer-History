<p>Old computers were the first models of what today are the fast and effective computers. Old computers were so slow, that in order to get information that was saved in a card, you needed to wait 3 minutes in order to get the computer going. Here is some history of old computers. <sup>(5)</sup> <br> <br>In 1822, Charles Babbage began developing what was considered to be the first automatic computing engine, called the “Difference Engine”, that was capable of computing many sets of numbers and making hard copies of the results. <sup>(5)</sup> <br> <br>In 1936, Konrad Zuse created the first electro-mechanical binary programmable computer and the first functional computer. <sup>(5)</sup> <br> <br>In 1942, Konrad Zuse started working on the Z4, which became the first commercial computer after being sold to Eduard Stiefel, a mathematician of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, in 1950. <sup>(5)</sup> <br> <br>In 1975, Ed Roberts created the first personal computer. This computer was based on multiple switches of inputting data and output data. <sup>(5)</sup> <br> <br> </p>
