<p>Computers are really simple to use. They could be used for working, school, online shopping, and everything that you can imagine. There are some important things that are needed for a computer to work. <br> <br>Some of the most important things that a computer needs are components. Components are the whole system that conform computers, and the reason that they work.
In few words, computers are a base of components which are indicated with a series of instructions which allows them to be able to make different actions and making us live our lives with many facilities in many ambits such as in school and when buying something from amazon. <sup>(4)</sup> <br> <br>The computer works basically in 4 major functions which are input, then the process of the information, this information can be stored and if not it comes to an output. <br> <br>All this can lead to components to know which kind of information the computer has far away from graphics and processor. <br> <br>This video will explain in more detail how these computers work from the inside, or the code behind it: <br> <br> <br>
