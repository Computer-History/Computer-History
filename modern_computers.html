<p>Modern Computers: Modern computers are the evolution of what old computers were once. Computers nowadays are a lot faster and efficient than in older times, since now they have a lot more capacity to perform more tasks. <br> <br>Modern computers are a lot more complex because they have many algorithms and many complex facilities which are implemented to modern computers such as memory, arithmetic operations and a faster processor which allow it to work in a more efficient way. <br> <br>Computers are still almost the same but they are empowered in a better way and making new facilities which helps us to make our projects and necessities in an easier way. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
