<p>Components are the core elements for a computer to work. Components have been evolving throughout the years, and some were made in the process, for computers to be faster and better. Here are the old components and modern components and what they do.
  <h3 class="header">Old Components</h2>
    <div id=imagesright>
      <h4 class="figure">Figure 1, Old Component</h4>

</div>
  <h3 class="header">Transistors</h3>
  <p>In 1956, Jack St. Clair Kilby invented the transistors, which were used to make chips. A chip is a collection of these transistors connected together to receive an output signal in response to an input signal. <sup>(6)</sup> <br> <br></p>
  <button onclick="myFunction()">Transistors Fun Fact</button>
  <h3 class="header">Vacuum tubes</h3>
  <p>The vacuum tubes were used for computers to perform digital computations, but were highly inefficient, and needed to be replaced frequently. Computers in the 40s and 50s had around 18,000 vacuum tubes in them, and maintaining and replacing these tubes was not cheap. <sup>(1)</sup> <br> <br> </p>
  <button onclick="myFunction2()">Vacuum Tubes Fun Fact</button>
  <h3 class="header">Circuit Board</h3>
  <p>A circuit board is a board where all of the other components are placed for them to work and are used to support and electrically connect all of the components using conductive pathways or signal traces that are printed into copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive membrane. The circuit boards are still used in modern computers for them to work. <sup>(6)</sup> <p>The vacuum tubes were used for computers to perform digital computations, but were highly inefficient, and needed to be replaced frequently. Computers in the 40s and 50s had around 18,000 vacuum tubes in them, and maintaining and replacing these tubes was not cheap. <sup>(6)</sup> <br> <br> </p>
  <button onclick="myFunction3()">Circuit Board Fun Fact</button>
  <h3 class="header">Silicon Chips</h3>
  <p>Silicon chips are still used nowadays. These silicon chips are used as the brain of the computer, and as the name indicates, they are made primarily from silicon. <sup>(6)</sup> <p>The vacuum tubes were used for computers to perform digital computations, but were highly inefficient, and needed to be replaced frequently. Computers in the 40s and 50s had around 18,000 vacuum tubes in them, and maintaining and replacing these tubes was not cheap. <sup>(6)</sup> <br> <br> </p>

    <h4 class="figure">Figure 2, Motherboard and its main components</h4>

</div>
  <h3>Modern Components</h3>
  <p>There are 5 main parts of a computer: <br> <br></p>
  <h3 class="header">Motherboard</h3>
  <p>The motherboard is the most important part of the computer. Without it, the computer wouldn’t work. The motherboard connects all of the components and cables that are needed for a pc to work. Motherboards can have more slots or less depending on how fast you want your pc to work. <sup>(3)</sup> <br> <br></p>
  <button onclick="myFunction5()">Motherboard Fun Fact</button>
  <h3 class="header">CPU</h3>
  <p>The CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, and without it, the computer wouldn't work. The CPU allows you to do everything that you want to do with a computer, and having a faster CPU will make your PC faster. <sup>(3)<sup> <br> <br></p>
    <button onclick="myFunction6()">CPU Fun Fact</button>
      <div id="imagesright">
        <h4 class="figure">Figure 3, Graphic Card</h4>
      <img src="assets/cm_10_3.jpg" alt="Graphics Card" id="graphic"  width="400px" height="373px" onclick="newImage()">
      <p class="interact">Click on the image to see a modern GPU!</p>
    </div>
  <h3 class="header">GPU</h3>
  <p>The GPU, which is the graphic card, processes anything that is related to visuals and outputs of these visuals onto the monitor. GPUs are usually integrated into a CPU, but they don't perform as well as separate GPUs. <br> <br>GPUs are used mainly for word processing and minor games, but they also do tasks such as 3D GPU Rendering, video editing, graphic design, though you need to get a better GPU to perform these tasks. <sup>(3)</sup> </p>
  <button onclick="myFunction7()">GPU Fun Fact</button>
  <h3 class="header">RAM</h3>
  <p>The RAM, which stands for Random Access Memory, is used for storing all of the data that has been worked on your CPU. It can read and write information quickly, but does not work once it’s turned off. <br> <br>The motherboard has 4 slots for RAM to be installed, and there are ram modules with storage of 2, 4, 8, or 16 GB. <sup>(3)</sup> <br> <br></p>
  <button onclick="myFunction8()">RAM Fun Fact</button>
  <h3 class="header">Storage</h3>
  <p>Storage is important for RAM because it gives power to the component for it to store data. 3 types of storage are: HDD, SSD, and NVMe SSD. <br> <br>The HDD is the slowest of the 3, reading and saving data at 100MByte/s. <br><br>The SSD is a lot faster than the HDD, which reads and saves data at around 500MByte/s. <br> <br>Finally, the NVMe SSD is the fastests of the 3, reading and saving data at 7000MBytes/s. <sup>(3)</sup> <br> <br>
